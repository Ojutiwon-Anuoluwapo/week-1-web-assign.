# ðŸ§® Simple CLI Calculator

This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”on two numbers input at runtime.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts two numeric inputs (int or float)
- Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Neatly formats the result (e.g., displays `5.0` as `5`)
- Handles division by zero with an error message
- Validates unsupported operations with guidance

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the script with:

```bash
python wk_one_calculator.py
Follow the prompts in your terminal to input numbers and choose an operation.

ðŸ“¦ Example Output
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): /
10 / 5 = 2
âœ… Notes
If a result is a whole number (e.g. 5.0), it's displayed as 5 for cleaner output.

If the operation entered is invalid (like % or ^), the program will notify the user.
